'''You are working with the COVID dataset for California, which includes the number of cases and deaths for each day of 2020.
Find the day when the deaths/cases ratio was largest.

To do this, you need to first calculate the deaths/cases ratio and add it as a column to the DataFrame with the name 'ratio', then find the row that corresponds to the largest value.

Important: The output should be a DataFrame, containing all of the columns of the dataset for the corresponding row.'''




import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("ca-covid.csv")

df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)


df['ratio']=df['deaths']/df['cases']
max_ratio=df.loc[df['ratio']==df['ratio'].max()]
print(max_ratio)
